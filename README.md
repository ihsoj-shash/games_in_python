# games_in_python

This repo consists of a few simple games which I have developed as a part of learning while learning Python from Online courses.

1. random_walk.py --> A simple turtle race where in a user bets on a turtle before the race starts and watches turtles race against each other.
2. quiz_game.zip --> A simple quiz game built using Python OOP concepts.
3. snake_game.zip --> The classic snake game built using Python OOP concepts.
